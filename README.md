## File Structure
```bash
 javac CalculatorApp.java
 java CalculatorApp
```

## Controls
- Digits: `0–9`
- Decimal: `.`
- Operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Equals: `=` computes the current expression
- Delete: `DEL` removes the last character
- Clear: `C` resets the expression and display

## Customize Theme
Open `CalculatorApp.java` and tweak these areas:
- Color palette constants: `BG`, `PANEL_BG`, `DISPLAY_BG`, `TEXT`, `BTN_BG`, `BTN_BORDER`, `OP_BG`, `EQ_BG`, `CLEAR_BG`
- Card rounding: `new RoundedPanel(18)` (increase for softer corners)
- Hover/press feel: adjust brightness in `installHoverEffect` and `brighten(...)`
- Spacing: `new GridLayout(4, 4, 10, 10)` controls gaps between buttons

Example palette overrides (set in `main` using `UIManager.put`):
```java
UIManager.put("control", BG);
UIManager.put("text", TEXT);
UIManager.put("nimbusBase", BG);
UIManager.put("nimbusBlueGrey", PANEL_BG);
UIManager.put("background", BG);
UIManager.put("Panel.background", BG);
```

## Troubleshooting
• If the UI looks outdated, ensure your system supports Swing’s system look-and-feel (UIManager.getSystemLookAndFeelClassName()).
• On some desktop themes, button colors and borders may differ; this is expected with system-level UI consistency.
• For alignment or spacing issues, verify your layout managers (BorderLayout, GridLayout) are properly applied.
